# Unified build tooling for all five Delego contract crates.
#
# The same recipe names are mirrored in each crate's package.json
# (build-wasm / test / lint) so contributors can use either entry point.
#
# Requires: cargo + the wasm32-unknown-unknown target (see README).
# Optional: soroban CLI (https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools) for
# the optimize step — `build-all` skips optimization when soroban is absent.

# Names of the five contract crates (must match workspace member directory names).
contracts := "escrow permissions marketplace reputation delegation_registry"

# Canonical output directory for workspace release WASM artefacts.
wasm_dir := "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release"

build-wasm:
    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --workspace --exclude tests

# Build every contract WASM, then strip debug symbols with `soroban contract
# optimize` where the CLI is available.  The optimized files are written
# alongside the originals with an `.optimized.wasm` suffix.
